CS61C Spring 2014 Project 1 Task A Writeup

1. For each of the test image provided in advanced_tests/, which images are not recognized correctly?

sans_serif_5
serif_5
serif_8



2. For each test image listed in the previous question, What is the difference in "digit distances" between the recognized digit and the digit it is supposed to be (e.g. if a digit 3 is recognized as 8, and 3 has a "digit distance" of 10 while 8 has a "digit distance" of 20, then difference in distances is 20 - 10 = 10).

sans_serif_5: 8969982 (5 and 6)
serif_5: 9216499 (5 and 1)
serif_8: 6116396 (8 and 2)



3. Give a one to two sentence explanation on why you think the images mentioned above are recognized incorrectly.

The shape of the image is close to another number in different font. For example, the shape of sans_serif_5.bmp is actually closer to 6 than the 5 from template.
